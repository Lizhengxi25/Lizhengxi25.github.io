                I am currently an undergraduate student at MBZUAI, class of 2029. Before joining MBZUAI, I graduated from Beijing 101 High School with an International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.

                Throughout my academic journey, I have been driven by a core philosophy: <b>correct and refine intuitions using theory and experiment</b>.
                During the past few years, I have investigated the moving mechanisms of balls and applied them to basketball training. Currently, I am particularly interested in LLM reasoning and aspire to contribute meaningful research to the field.

                At the same time, I always keep myself open to exploring a broad range of topics including, but not limited to, multi-agent systems and computer vision.
