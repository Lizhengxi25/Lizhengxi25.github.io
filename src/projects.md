### How Does Spin Rate Affect the Trajectory of a Ping Pong Ball in Air?

_Investigation (IB Physics Internal Assessment, May 2025)_

Investigated how varying angular velocities influence the trajectory of a ping pong ball through the Magnus effect. 
Built an experimental setup to quantify changes in range and curvature at different spin rates.

### Numerical Study of Basketball Lay-up Shot

_Research Project (IB Mathematics AA Extended Essay, May 2025)_

Modeled the trajectory of a basketball lay-up shot using numerical simulation techniques.
Analyzed the relationship between release angle, velocity, and scoring probability through
kinematic equations and computational methods. Demonstrated how small variations in angle 
significantly influence the optimal release conditions for a successful shot.
