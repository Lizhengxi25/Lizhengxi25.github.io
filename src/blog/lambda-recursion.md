_In my younger and more vulnerable years my mentor gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since._

_"In research," he told me, "taste is everything. Your work should set the standard—become the paradigm others follow. Hold that confidence, that ambition, regardless of where you stand today."_

_Half a year into writing this blog, I have yet to pen a single article about computer science proper—just a few of competitive programming tutorials. The truth is, I simply haven't produced any investigation worth turning into an article. Today's piece, "On the Recursion of Lambda Expressions," stems from a small investigation I'm quite pleased with. It embodies taste in two dimensions: the elegance of a one-liner reflects the aesthetic of simplicity; the subtleties of language fundamentals reflect depth of understanding. This is not a discovery from zero to one, but rather an investigation conducted with care and effort._
